### To do list

* Move all config reprocessing to the extensionPoint, so profiles work better.
* Add config checkboxes to follow or not config profile changes, maybe separately for numlock and nav mode. (half done)
* Refactor key handling so that all modifiers are possible.
* Switch from namedtuple to a metadata class.
* Investigate numlockManager's onHelp, and re-focusing code, to see if it can be useful.
